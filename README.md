RockPython is an educational project to compile a subset of Python to machine
code.

Ideas if things get serious:

- Use LLVM for RockPython backend
- Use the Objective-C runtime for dynamic typing and the object system (or glib, or something)
- Tagged pointers

For now, though, the goal is to learn about file formats and generating x86-64
machine code.
